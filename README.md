# Document-AI — PDF Question Answering System

Built an end-to-end RAG application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their contents. The system extracts and chunks document text, generates embeddings, stores them in a vector database, retrieves relevant context through semantic search, and uses an LLM to generate grounded answers
